                    <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
                    <p>I am a student, hobby programmer, burgeoning musician, gamer, anime fan, exercise enthusiast, bookworm, and sandwich artist.
                        It's a lot to do with such limited time, but I structure my days to be able to be productive in each
                        of these fields. Most of my time is spent as a student, learning various hard, soft skills and expanding my knowledge.
                        With these acquired skills I create projects that interest me and can help others. With the experience gained
                        from my studies and projects, I believe I can be an asset to any team.
                    </p>
                    <p>My goal is to work as a full-time software engineer or data scientist, creating tools that make me a better engineer and provide value to others.</p>
                    <h1>Origin</h1>
                    <p>I am proudly born in Bangladesh, a tropical country in South Asia. I lived there for 6 years before
                        immigrating with my parents to the United States in 2009. The community I grew up in and am still a part of is defined by being the first.
                        We are first generation Bengali-Americans. We are first generation college students. We are the first in our families
                        to have the potential to build a sturdy foundation for future generations. With this responsibility 
                        we must aspire to inspire the next generation to take our example and build upon it or create their own path.
                        As my generation has grown into adults, they have become biologists, accountants, mechanical engineers, and teachers.
                        But no software engineers. Just as my fellow community members are a source of inspiration for the children in their
                        respective fields, I strive to be one to inspire the next generation to follow in my footsteps. To show them 
                        it is possible to be a software engineer.</p>

                    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                    <h1 id="hobby-h1">Gaming</h1>
                    <p>
                        I started off gaming on a PS4 my parents got me during middleschool. I had never really had anything quite like it
                        before, so when my friend introduced me to Destiny 1, I was immediately addicted to the grind. For the first few
                        months my friend was there to show me the ropes and be there for raids, but he discovered Fallout 4 and disappeared.
                        I was still hopelessly addicted. I started messing around with the games multiplayer and sucked for months before
                        I learned how to properly aim and strafe. Once I got good though, multiplayer started to get boring because I could
                        pull out the No Land Beyond, Queen Breakers Bow combo and still top frag. That's when I started coaching for the Kings Fall raid.
                        I used the skills I'd built from playing and strategies from my friend to lead dozens of successful raids. It
                        wasn't an easy task because some people were just REALLY bad at the game. It felt like they'd just picked up a controller
                        for the first time. A distinct memory I have is during the platforming section of the raid one of the members was
                        having a lot of trouble jumping onto the moving ships, but insisted he could do it. I think we waited half an hour for him to lock-in before I
                        decided he couldn't do it on his own and basically piggy backed him to the end. We were able to complete the raid by some miracle.
                        I can't remember how long I spent coaching, but I got bored after doing the same things for so long. I decided to try somthing new.
                        While Destiny has a special place in my heart as my first video game I'm glad I moved on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I settled on Fallout 4 after asking my friend what he reccommended. It was a pretty fun game for me since I'd
                        never played an rpg before. But since then I've finished around a hundred games and compared to The Witcher 3 or New
                        Vegas, it's pretty milquetoast. My favorite games are The Witcher 3, New Vegas, Monster Hunter, Sekiro, and Nier: Automata.

                    <h1 id="hobby-h1">Anime</h1>
                    <p>
                        Fairy Tail, a story about a group of super powered teens with way too much fan service was my first anime all the way back in elementary school.
                        I was visiting a neighbors house and noticed their kid was watching the show and asked them about it. From where they were at
                        it seemed like an exciting show with cool action sequences, so I decided to watch it. At the time I enjoyed the show, it had what
                        I was looking for- cool action scenes and it also had some nice character moments. But towards the end it got really stale and I stopped watching.
                        I can't remember too much about it, but it definately influenced the future shows I watched. I went on a relentless tirade watching
                        tons of rom-coms, the good and the trashy. I can only remember Hyouka, Kaguya Sama, Kaichou wa Maid Sama, Toradara, and Oregairu. The
                        rest are where they belong: the void. Once I came to my senses, I started watching all the classic stuff like Naruto, Bleach,
                        Hunter X Hunter, Gintama, etc. With my developed taste in anime, my favorites are Gintama, Kaguya Sama, Konosuba, Mob Pyscho 100,
                        and Monster.
                    </p>
                    <h1 id="hobby-h1">Exercise</h1>
                    <p>
                        My love for exercise and fitness began after I decided to join the football team as a short, scrawny freshman in high school.
                        The first few weeks of conditioning were brutal, since I'd spend most of my time sitting or lying down. I wanted to quit
                        because it felt like too much, but I kept at it because of the encouragement I got from my teammates. Once I got past my first
                        season and we hit winter weight lifting, is when I really discovered my passion for exercise. Back then I was 120 lbs and could
                        barely lift the bar. The days after lifting for the first time, I was sore all over and had terrible mobility. But after it
                        passed I noticed the bar wasn't so heavy anymore. I started to enjoy it. Fast-forward to now, my peak lifts at 140 lbs were:
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Bench Press: 185 lbs<br>Deadlift: 315 lbs<br>Squat: 265 lbs</p>
